# Currency Exchange Frontend

A modern, fully responsive currency exchange application built with Next.js, featuring real-time exchange rates, transaction management, and comprehensive audit trails.

Important Notice: The ExchangeRate API has usage limits for free users. Consider upgrading to a paid plan for production use.

Also, the backend is hosted on an hosting server free plan and it sometimes shuts down if it's not been used for a while, leading to an longer response time.

According to the provider - "Your free instance will spin down with inactivity, which can delay requests by 50 seconds or more."
